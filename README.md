# DRY Code Snippets Repository API

## Purpose

The DRY Code Snippets Repository API helps developers store, share, and retrieve reusable code snippets. By promoting the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle, this API saves time and effort, enhances maintainability, and encourages better code practices. Developers can easily find and contribute high-quality code snippets for common tasks, reducing code duplication across projects.

## Key Features

### Snippet Storage
- Store reusable code snippets categorized by programming languages, frameworks, and functionalities (e.g., database operations, validation functions, etc.).
- Each snippet includes a **title**, **description**, **code example**, and **tags** (e.g., `React`, `authentication`, `utility`).
  
### Snippet Search
- Users can search for specific code snippets using **keywords**, **tags**, and **languages**.
- Search filters based on **snippet type** (e.g., utility, validation, API call) allow users to find relevant code faster.

### Snippet Versioning
- Multiple versions of a snippet can be created, keeping a history of changes.
- Allows users to compare different versions and see improvements or changes.

### Sharing & Collaboration
- Share snippets publicly with the community or privately with specific teams.
- Option to comment on snippets for feedback, suggestions, or improvements.
  
### Snippet Suggestions (AI-powered)
- Suggest snippets based on the user's project context or code already written.
- Helps developers avoid repetitive coding by recommending reusable code.

### Integration with IDEs/Editors
- Seamlessly integrate snippets into popular IDEs or editors (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, JetBrains) through a plugin or extension.
- Developers can use the DRY practices directly within their workflow.

### Code Quality Check
- Automatically checks the code for **linting** and **quality** to ensure it adheres to coding standards and follows DRY principles.

### Snippet Rating & Community Voting
- Users can rate snippets based on **quality**, **clarity**, and **utility**.
- Snippets with the highest ratings can be featured as **"Best Practices"**.
